        <p class="lead">Your privacy is important to us. This policy outlines how Twoem V2 collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users of our website and services.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect personal identification information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our site, register on the site, fill out a form (e.g., contact form), and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, email address, phone number, and other relevant details for service provision.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Collected Information</h2>
        <p>Twoem V2 may collect and use Users' personal information for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>To personalize user experience:</strong> We may use information in the aggregate to understand how our Users as a group use the services and resources provided.</li>
            <li><strong>To process payments (if applicable):</strong> We may use the information Users provide about themselves when placing an order only to provide service to that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to provide the service.</li>
            <li><strong>To send periodic emails:</strong> We may use the email address to send User information and updates pertaining to their inquiries or services. It may also be used to respond to their inquiries, questions, and/or other requests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Protect Your Information</h2>
        <p>We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password (if applicable), transaction information and data stored on our systems.</p>
        <p>Sensitive and private data exchange between the Site and its Users happens over a SSL secured communication channel where possible and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures. (Note: User should ensure SSL is implemented for production environments).</p>

        <h2>4. Sharing Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent Users personal identification information to others.

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>
        <p>For any documents submitted for download (e.g., eulogies), retention periods will be clearly communicated or are time-limited by nature, after which they may be removed from public access.</p>
